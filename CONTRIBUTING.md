# Contributing to idem

This document describes the contribution process for idem. This package
follows tidyverse conventions for code style and workflow — see the
[tidyverse development contributing guide](https://rstd.io/tidy-contrib)
and [code review principles](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/) for
broader context.

## Before you start

File an issue before writing any code. This ensures the change is needed
and avoids wasted effort. If you have found a bug, include a minimal
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) in the issue — this
makes it easier to diagnose and to write a unit test later. The
tidyverse guide on [how to create a great
issue](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/issues/) has useful advice.

## Prerequisites

The following tools must be available on your `PATH` before following
the contribution workflow. Install them once and they will work across
all projects.

### uv

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) is a
Python package manager used to install the other tools.

**Windows** ([installation
guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#__tabbed_1_2)):

``` powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**macOS / Linux** ([installation
guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#__tabbed_1_1)):

``` sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### pre-commit

[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) runs the hook scripts before each
commit. Install it via uv (recommended):

``` sh
uv tool install pre-commit
```

Alternatives: `pip install pre-commit` or `brew install pre-commit`.

## Branching model

This repository uses a **release-branch workflow**:

1.  A `release/vX.Y.Z` branch is created by a maintainer for each
    planned release.
2.  Each piece of work (feature, fix, docs, etc.) gets its own branch
    cut **from the target release branch**, named
    `<issue-number>-brief-description`
    (e.g. `7-improve-contributing-guide`).
3.  Completed feature branches are merged into the release branch via a
    pull request. All CI checks must pass before merging.
4.  When a release is ready, the release branch is merged into `main`.
    The merge commit is tagged with the version number (e.g. `v0.2.0`).

Maintainers create and manage release branches. If you are an external
contributor, check whether an active release branch exists and target
your PR there. If none exists, ask in your issue which branch to use.

``` mermaid
gitGraph
   commit id: "…"
   branch release/v0.2.0
   checkout release/v0.2.0

   branch "5-add-validation"
   checkout "5-add-validation"
   commit id: "feat: add validation"
   commit id: "test: cover validation"
   checkout release/v0.2.0
   merge "5-add-validation" id: "Merge #5"

   branch "6-fix-edge-case"
   checkout "6-fix-edge-case"
   commit id: "fix: edge case"
   checkout release/v0.2.0
   merge "6-fix-edge-case" id: "Merge #6"

   checkout main
   merge release/v0.2.0 id: "v0.2.0" tag: "v0.2.0"
```

## Contribution workflow

### 1. Fork and clone

Fork the repository and clone it locally. The easiest way is:

``` r

usethis::create_from_github("impact-initiatives/idem", fork = TRUE)
```

Or with plain git:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/idem.git
cd idem
git remote add upstream https://github.com/impact-initiatives/idem.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies and verify the baseline

``` r

devtools::install_dev_deps()
devtools::check()
```

R CMD check must pass cleanly before you make any changes. If it does
not, open an issue rather than continuing.

Before moving on, install the pre-commit hooks — see [Pre-commit
hooks](#pre-commit-hooks) below. The hooks must be in place before you
make your first commit.

### 3. Create a branch

Create your branch **from the active release branch**:

``` sh
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b <issue-number>-brief-description-of-change upstream/release/vX.Y.Z
```

### 4. Make changes and commit

Follow the [commit message format](#commit-message-format) described
below. Each commit should be a coherent, self-contained unit of work.
The PR as a whole should address just one thing — see the tidyverse
guide on [focused
PRs](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/author/focused.html).

### 5. Push and open a PR

When ready, push and open a PR:

``` r

usethis::pr_push()
```

Or with plain git:

``` sh
git push -u origin 7-brief-description-of-change
```

Then open a pull request on GitHub. The PR title must briefly describe
the change. The PR body must contain `Fixes #<issue-number>`.

## Pre-commit hooks

[Pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) are tests that run each time
you attempt to commit. If the tests pass, the commit will be made,
otherwise not.

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run
automated checks before each commit. The hook scripts are not committed
to the repository — every contributor must install them locally after
cloning. The steps below are **required, not optional**: without them
the hooks will not run.

### 1. Install the precommit R package and activate the hooks

The [`precommit`](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/) R package
provides a convenient way to install the pre-commit framework and
activate the hooks from R. Run the following in an R session from the
root of the cloned repository:

``` r

install.packages("precommit")
precommit::use_precommit()
```

`precommit::use_precommit()` writes the hook scripts into `.git/hooks/`.
The pre-commit framework must already be installed — see
[Prerequisites](#prerequisites) if you have not done so yet. You only
need to run this once per clone.

> \[!CAUTION\] Do not abort while hooks are running in RStudio git tab.
> Non-staged changes are stashed to a temp directory and when you abort
> in RStudio, these changes are not brought back to you repo.
>
> — [precommit
> documentation](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/articles/precommit.html#caution)

This installs both the `pre-commit` and `commit-msg` hooks. The
`commit-msg` hook enforces the [Conventional
Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format — see [Commit
message format](#commit-message-format) below for the rules and allowed
types.

### Run hooks manually

To run all hooks against every file without making a commit:

``` sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run a single hook by its id:

``` sh
pre-commit run <hook-id> --all-files
# e.g.
pre-commit run lintr --all-files
```

### Hook reference

### Commit message format

The `conventional-pre-commit` hook enforces the [Conventional
Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. Every
commit message must start with a type prefix:

    type: short description in the imperative mood

Types used in this repository:

| Type       | When to use                                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `feat`     | A new feature or behaviour                                   |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                                    |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes only                                   |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature      |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                                     |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks (dependency updates, config changes, etc.) |

Example: `feat: add validate_choices() function`

Commits that do not follow this format will be rejected by the hook.

## Code style

- New code must follow the [tidyverse style
  guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). The `air-format` hook applies
  this automatically on commit — do not restyle code that is unrelated
  to your change.

- To format manually before committing:

  ``` sh
  air format .
  ```

  Or format a single file:

  ``` sh
  air format R/my_file.R
  ```

- To lint R source files:

  ``` r

  lintr::lint_package()
  ```

- This package uses
  [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2) with [Markdown
  syntax](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd-formatting.html) for
  all documentation. After editing roxygen2 comments, regenerate the
  docs:

  ``` r

  devtools::document()
  ```

- This package uses
  [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) (v3) for unit
  tests. Contributions that include test cases are easier to accept.
